# Evo-Edu-Code

**Evo-Edu-Code** is a collection of JavaScript-based web applications designed for evolutionary education, visualization, and computation. This repository serves as a central hub for web-based tools that facilitate learning about evolutionary biology, phylogenetics, population genetics, and related topics.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to support multiple JavaScript web applications, each within its own directory:

```
/apps/
    /app1/
        index.html
        script.js
        style.css
    /app2/
        index.html
        main.js
        styles.css
/assets/       # Shared images, icons, and other resources
/docs/         # Documentation and guides
README.md      # This file
```

Each application is self-contained, making it easy to update or add new tools over time.

## Purpose and Goals

This repository serves several key purposes:

- **Provide accessible, web-based education tools.**  
  Many scientific and educational tools were originally written in languages like C, Java, or Python, limiting their accessibility. This repository aims to create **browser-friendly** versions that can run without installation.
  
- **Host interactive simulations and visualizations.**  
  By using JavaScript and modern web technologies, these tools can run directly in a browser, making them useful for teaching and outreach.

- **Maintain an evolving collection of educational software.**  
  As new tools are created or adapted, they will be added to this repository and made available via GitHub Pages.

## Original Software Attribution and Contact

Some of the JavaScript applications in this repository are **web-based reimplementations** of programs originally written in other languages by different individuals or research groups. Wherever possible, attribution to the original authors and sources is provided in the application pages and/or documentation.

If you are an original author of a program that has been reimplemented here and have concerns, please **contact Wesley R. Elsberry** to discuss attribution, modifications, or removal as needed.

## Use of Generative AI in Development at Evo-Edu-Code

Many of the JavaScript web applications in this repository have been created or refined with the assistance of generative AI tools. These tools have been used for tasks such as:

- **Generating boilerplate code** for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Providing algorithmic implementations** for simulations and visualizations.
- **Refactoring and optimizing code** for clarity, efficiency, and maintainability.
- **Converting concepts from other programming languages** into JavaScript for browser-based use.

Additionally, generative AI os applied to produce documentation, descriptions, and curriculum alignment materials.

### AI-Generated Code Disclaimer

While generative AI is a powerful tool for code generation and problem-solving, it is not infallible. Users should be aware that:

- **AI-generated code is reviewed and tested** before inclusion in this repository, but errors or inefficiencies may still exist. Contributions for improvements are welcome.
- **AI does not guarantee originality or correctness.** Some outputs may unintentionally resemble existing solutions or contain subtle logical errors.
- **Ethical and legal considerations apply.** AI-generated content is meant to support open, educational use. If any generated implementation inadvertently conflicts with existing copyrighted material or intellectual property, please contact **Wesley R. Elsberry** for resolution.

By acknowledging the role of AI in development, this project aims to balance innovation with responsible usage, ensuring that the educational tools provided here are reliable, transparent, and useful for learning.


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If youâ€™d like to report a bug, suggest a feature, or add a new JavaScript application to the collection, please submit an issue or a pull request.
